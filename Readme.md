Each of homeworks focus on another skills, but every is made using SwiftUI framework. 

1. homework require some knowledge about basic algorithms and structure.

4. homework used MVVM architecture to divide model from the view.
5. homework focuesed on concurrency and fetching data from API. With the use of async/await.
